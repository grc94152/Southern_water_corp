I worked on a case study to help Southern Water Corp understand the anomalies of their pumping operations and predict potential pump failures in their operations.<br />
<br />
The following tools and libraries were used during my analysis:<br />
<br />
* Excel<br />
* Python<br />
* Numpy<br />
* Pandas<br />
* Matplotlib<br />
* Seaborn<br />
* Statsmodels<br />
<br />
For further details on my analysis, please refer to the Jupyter Notebook in this repository.<br />
